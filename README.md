# An Introductory Course to Scientific Computing & Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains all the files (slides, source code & data) used in the first two days of the [Scientific Python Course at TU Braunschweig](https://musenzentrum.de/workshop2021/).

The target audience is someone with a bit of prior programming knowledge, but in a different language like MATLAB. It is helpful to understand some linear algebra in order to follow the examples in the sections on Machine Learning & Deep Learning.

The course is supposed to be interactive for people to code along the instructor.
